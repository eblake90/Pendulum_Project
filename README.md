# Pendulum_Project
This is a Python simulation made during my physic bachelors and its purpose was to study the physical properties of single and double compound pendulums. The goal was to understand the factors influencing the pendulum's behavior in an undamped system. 
Different parameters were manually adjusted to observe their impact on pendulum oscillations. Key findings include:

The single compound pendulum behaves linearly, while the double compound pendulum exhibits non-linear behavior.
The constant of proportionality greatly affects the oscillation frequency.
For the single compound pendulum, minor adjustments in initial parameters result in slight changes in outcomes. However, for the double compound pendulum, the same adjustments can lead to drastically different results.
